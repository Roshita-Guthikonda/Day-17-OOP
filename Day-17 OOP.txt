Day-17 OOP
============
(Object Oriented Programming)
------------------------------
Class and Objects:
====================
Class- Class is a group of elements having common properties and behavior.
   Object- Object is an individual element in the group of elements having physical properties and physical behaviors.

2. Class is virtual
   Object is Physical or real

3. Class is virtual encapsulation of properties and behaviors.
   Object is physical encapsulation of properties and behaviors.

4. Class is Generalization
   Object is specialization

5. Class is a blue print for Objects
   Object is instance of a class.

Class Structure in java
========================
A basic class in java has the following structure

//access modifier + class keyword + class name
public class ClassName{
//fields(attributes/properties)
//datatypes + variable name
private datatype fieldname;

//methods(behaviors/operations)
public returnType methodName(parameters){
//method body
//logic and operations
}
}

Member methods of a class
--------------------------
Member methods are functions defined within a class that perform operations on the class data or provide certain functionality. They represent the behaviors of the objects created from the class.

Types of member methods
------------------------
1.Accessor Methods(Getters): return the value of primitive attribute.
2.Mutator Methods(Setter): modify the value of primitive attributes.
3.Operations Methods: Perform operations using class attribute.
4.static Methods: Belonging to the class rather than objects.
5.final Methods: Cannot be overridden by subclass.
6.abstract Methods: Method without implementation(used in abstract class).

Method structure
-----------------
accessModifier  [static][final] returnType
methodName(ParameterList){
//method body
//logic and operations
//return value; //if return type is not void
}


Creating Objects
==================
ClassName objName=new ClassName();
